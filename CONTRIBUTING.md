Of course this is not the way developers probably want a Product Manager to interact, but how else can I comment on an idea I have for this insatgram-scraper.  I'd like to teach kids how to scrape their accounts.  It might sound crazy, but K-12 aged children need to be learning to code.  They will naturally be interested in scraping publicly available data about themselves or photos their names were tagged in.  If I could get a CSV file with only inputting my email address, then return to me all taggs associated with that email, then we sould have something interesting for the kids to learn how to query/filter data with simple select statements.  Interested?  or Interested in building a training outline for youth?
