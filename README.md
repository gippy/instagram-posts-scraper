## Features

Since Instagram has removed the option to load public data through its API, this actor should help replace this functionality. It allows you to scrape posts from a user's profile page, hashtag page or place. When a link to an Instagram post is provided, it can scrape Instagram comments.

The Instagram data scraper supports the following features:

- Scrape profiles - you can either scrape posts or get metadata from the profile (including followers and following if logged in)

- Scrape hashtags - query hastags matched by search keyword you can either scrape posts or scrape metadata from each hashtag

- Scrape places/locations - query places matched by search keyword you can either scrape posts or scrape metadata from each place (scrolling for more posts in places/locations in only possible when logged in)

- Scrape comments - you can scrape comments from any post

- Scrape likes - you can scrape likes from any post (if logged in)

If you are interested in this solution and want to know more about how it works, I wrote a short introduction on [Apify blog](https://medium.com/p/21d05506aeb3).

## Features planned

In the future, this solution will be extended with following features:

- Scraping of Instagram stories
- Scraping and download of Instagram photos

## Bugs, fixes, updates and changelog
This scraper is under active development. Check [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/gippy/instagram-scraper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more detailed information
- 2020-07-02 - Scraping places/locations now requires login.
- 2020-06-12 - Big update with many fixes and new features

## Instagram blocking and proxies
In May 2020, Instagram significantly upgraded their anti-scraping protection, banning most datacenter proxies worldwide. Many of the previously working solutions were completely blocked by redirecting the pages into login wall. Currently, the only reliable solution to this problem is to use residential proxies. Datacenter proxies may still work but likely in less than 10% of cases.

### Apify residential proxies
Apify platform [provides residential proxies](https://apify.com/proxy?pricing=residential-ip#pricing) for extra fee. These proxies are only sold to be run with the scrapers like this one, not externally. If you are interested in buying some residential GBs, just ping support@apify.com and they will get back to you with more detailed offer.

### Custom proxies
You can also use proxies from other providers in the custom proxies fields (`proxyUrls` in the JSON settings).

## Scrolling through large profiles or posts
Instagram imposes a rate limits that will block the scrolling if you want to scroll for more than 1000 posts or comments. To workaround this issue, this scraper starts injecting randomized wait times once you reach 1000 posts or comments. This is configurable by the `scrollWaitSecs` input parameter. If you get the message that you were rate limited, consider increasing this parameter for the specific profile or post.

## Input parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on Instagram that should be visited. Required fields are:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| search | String | (optional) Query to search Instagram for |
| pageTimeout | Integer | (optional) Defaults to 60 (seconds) |
| searchType | String | (optional, required with search) What to search Instagram for, default is "hashtag", other options are "user" or "place"  |
| searchLimit | Integer | (optional) How many search results to process, default is 20, maximum is 100. Set to 1 if you want to get the most matched one |
| directUrls | Array | (optional) List of Instagram URLs (profile or hashtag or place) |
| resultsType | String | What to scrape from each page, default is "posts" the other option is "comments" |
| resultsLimit | Integer | How many items should be loaded from each URL (limit is per page) |
| proxy | Object | Proxy configuration |
| scrapePostsUntilDate | String | (optional) Date in the past when you stop scrolling older posts |
| scrollWaitSecs | Number | How long to wait every 100 scolled items to prevent blocking by Instagram. This number is randomized. Default is 10 seconds |
| loginCookies | Array | (optional) Cookies copied from logged in profile (for example using EditThisCookie extension) |
| likedByLimit | Number | (optional) How many likes should be scraped from post page (only works with login) |
| followingLimit | Number | (optional) How many following should be scraped from profile page (only works with login) |
| followedByLimit | Number | (optional) How many followers should be scraped from profile page (only works with login) |
| expandOwners | Boolean | (optional) **!Experimental!** Load additional details about post owner for each post (slows down the solution a lot) |

This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy">Apify Proxy</a>.

### Instagram scraper Input example
```json
{
    "search": "Náměstí míru",
    "searchType": "place",
    "searchLimit": 10,
    "directUrls": [ "https://www.instagram.com/teslamotors/" ],
    "resultsType": "posts",
    "resultsLimit": 100,
    "proxy": { "useApifyProxy": true, "apifyProxyGroups": [] }
}

```

## Using cookies to log in
This solution allows you to log in using already initialized cookies of logged in user.
If you use this option, the solution will do as much as possible to prevent the account from being banned (slow down to just one page open at a time and introduce delays between actions).

**It's highly recommended not to use your own account (unless you have to) and instead create a new instagram account to use with this solution.**
**Using your own account can result in the account being banned by Instagram.**

To log in using cookies. I recommend using chrome browser extension like [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=cs). With it, just go to Instagram,
log in with the account you want to use and then use the extension to export cookies. This should give you an array of cookies which you can then just paste as a value of `loginCookies` field in input.

**If you log out of instagram with the account that is connected to the cookies, it will invalidate them and your solution will stop working.**

## During the run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Instagram output format

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Instagram actor.

## How to scrape Instagram blogpost
I wrote a short introduction to this solution and how it works. You can find it at [blog.apify.com](https://medium.com/p/21d05506aeb3)

## Extend output function

You can use this function to update the result output of this actor. You can query html dom what data from the page you want to scrape. The output from this will function will get merged with the result output.

The return value of this function has to be an object!
